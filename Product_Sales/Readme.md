##  Conclusion :
The business is generating strong revenue and stable order volume, but high return rates are impacting net profitability. 
Regions like North and promotion-based sales contribute most revenue but also cause higher returns. Optimizing promotions, 
improving delivery quality, and reducing returns can significantly improve net sales and operational efficiency.
